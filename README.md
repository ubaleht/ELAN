# ELAN
Tools for processing ELAN annotation files.

At this moment, this project consists of the following tools:
- Parser for ELAN \*.eaf (XML) annotation files (creates a tree of objects in memory from annotations). Now, this parser is not universal;
- An application that creates SQL-insert commands for MS SQL server database from a tree of objects (from annotations).
